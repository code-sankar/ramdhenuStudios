# Ramdhenu — a step towards digital presence

Marketing site for Ramdhenu, a digital agency for local businesses. React + Vite,
built to the **Industry** design system exported from Claude Design.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # → dist/
npm run preview
npm run lint
```

## The design system

`src/styles/industry.css` is the exported Industry stylesheet, shipped **verbatim**
as the single source of truth for colour, type, spacing, radius and elevation.
`src/styles/INDUSTRY-README.md` is its authoring guide — read it before changing
anything visual. The short version:

| | |
|---|---|
| Ground | `--color-bg` `#f2f2f3` paper, `--color-surface` for recessed bands |
| Field | `--color-accent-900` `#1d2d3d` steel — hero and contact, type reversed out |
| Accent | `--color-accent` `#5980a6`, one steel ramp, no second hue |
| Type | Barlow Condensed 600 headings over Barlow body |
| Objects | square corners, hairline borders, `+` registration marks at each corner |
| Icons | Lucide geometry at stroke-width 1.5 |

Two rules from the guide the code depends on:

- **Take every value from a token.** No hex codes, font names or raw pixel values
  that `var(--color-*)`, `var(--font-*)`, `var(--space-*)` or `var(--radius-*)`
  already carry. `src/styles/app.css` is the page layer and introduces none of
  its own.
- **A framed element never drops its marks.** `<Blueprint>` owns the border and
  all four corner marks together, so the frame can't be rendered without them.

Tailwind was removed when the system landed: its utility scale would be a second,
competing set of tokens, which is exactly what the guide warns against.

## Structure

```
src/
  styles/
    industry.css   the design system, exported verbatim — source of truth
    app.css        page layer: layout and sections, composed from DS tokens
    fonts.css      self-hosted Barlow / Barlow Condensed @font-face rules
  data/            all copy — site.js, services.js, testimonials.js, legal.js
  components/
    Blueprint.jsx    the wireframe frame + its four registration marks
    Plate.jsx        drawn spec-sheet figure, stands in for absent photography
    Logo.jsx         the wordmark — swap in the official artwork here
    Icon.jsx         the Lucide glyphs actually used, inline
    Reveal.jsx       one short scroll entrance, reused everywhere
    EnquiryForm.jsx  the conversion point — validation + WhatsApp/POST delivery
    Dialog.jsx       the system's modal, made keyboard-safe
    LegalDialogs.jsx privacy + terms, opened from the footer
    Header · Hero · About · Services · Testimonials · Contact · Footer
```

Sections follow the artboard: **Hero → About → Services → Testimonials → Contact.**

## Before this goes live

Nothing on this site fakes what the agency hasn't earned yet. Everything unproven
is flagged in place, and each flag is a one-line change in `src/data/`. The full
checklist lives at the top of `src/data/site.js`.

| What | Where | To publish |
|---|---|---|
| Contact details | `site.js` → `contact` | Real phone, WhatsApp number, email, studio address |
| Social profiles | `site.js` → `socials` | Replace the `#` hrefs |
| Live domain | `site.js` → `siteUrl`, plus `index.html` | Canonical URL, OG tags, structured data, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` |
| Example projects | `services.js` → `PROJECTS_ARE_PLACEHOLDER` | Real permissioned work, then set the flag to `false` |
| Placeholder quotes | `testimonials.js` → `TESTIMONIALS_ARE_PLACEHOLDER` | Permissioned quotes and photos, then `false` |
| Legal copy | `legal.js` → `LEGAL_NEEDS_REVIEW` | Have both documents reviewed, then `false` |

The About stats (`site.js` → `stats`) describe how the team is built — six
disciplines, one point of contact, 48h first response — rather than claiming
project volume. They're true on day one and need no disclaimer.

## The enquiry form

The site funnels into one conversion point, and it works today with no backend:
the form validates, composes the enquiry and hands it to WhatsApp, with email as
a fallback. Both land somewhere the team already reads.

To store submissions instead, set `enquiry.endpoint` in `src/data/site.js` to a
URL that accepts a POST (Formspree, a serverless function, a CRM webhook). The
form then posts JSON and reports success inline; WhatsApp stays available as the
second path. Nothing else changes.

```js
export const enquiry = {
  endpoint: "https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx",   // null → WhatsApp handoff
  whatsappGreeting: "Hi Ramdhenu, I'd like to talk about…",
};
```

## The logo

The official artwork ships **white-on-transparent**, which is right for the steel
hero but would disappear on the paper ground the header and footer sit on. So the
PNG is used as a **CSS mask filled with `currentColor`** rather than placed as an
`<img>`: one asset serves every ground, in the exact token colour of wherever it
lands, and it follows the palette if the system is ever retuned.

Two variants, because the lockup does not survive being shrunk:

| Variant | What | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| `mark` | the monogram alone — legible down to ~24px | header (beside the name), hero headline |
| `lockup` | mark + wordmark + tagline — needs ~56px of height before the tagline resolves | footer |

The header pairs the official mark with the name set in Barlow Condensed, the same
condensed grotesque the artwork's own wordmark uses. The hero locks the mark into
the headline where the artboard calls for a photograph — it belongs in that
sentence better than a stand-in image would, and it swaps out the moment a real
team shot exists.

```
src/assets/brand/          full-resolution originals, versioned, never shipped
  logo-mark-source.png       7500×7500
  logo-lockup-source.png     7500×3000
src/assets/               optimised derivatives the site imports
  logo-mark.png              1.6 MB → 10 KB
  logo-lockup.png            555 KB → 47 KB
public/                   favicons + share card, opaque steel tile
```

After replacing a source file, regenerate the derivatives:

```bash
node scripts/generate-brand-assets.mjs   # logo assets + favicons
node scripts/generate-og-image.mjs       # social share card
```

(Both drive headless Chromium; `playwright` is already a devDependency.)

Originals live in `src/assets/brand/` rather than `public/` deliberately —
anything in `public/` is copied verbatim into the build, so the 2.2 MB of
full-resolution artwork would ship to every visitor.

## Adding real photography

Figures render a drawn blueprint plate until a photograph exists. Drop the file in
`src/assets/work/` and set `image` on the project:

```js
project: {
  image: new URL("../assets/work/greenwood-resort.jpg", import.meta.url).href,
}
```

The component then swaps the plate for the photo and applies the system's
`.duotone` wash automatically. Duotone is only ever applied to real photographs —
it flattens a line drawing into a solid field.

## SEO

`index.html` carries the canonical URL, Open Graph and Twitter cards, and
`ProfessionalService` structured data — the schema type that earns the knowledge
panel and Maps treatment a local agency depends on, which is the same surface the
Google Business service sells to clients. `public/` holds `robots.txt`,
`sitemap.xml` and the share card. **All of these hardcode the domain**; update
them together with `siteUrl`.

## Type

Barlow and Barlow Condensed are served from `public/fonts` (Latin + Latin-Extended,
~144 KB) rather than the Google Fonts CDN the design system imports by default:
one less DNS + TLS handshake before first paint, no third-party request from a
visitor's browser, and the type still renders offline.

## Accessibility

Keyboard focus uses the system's 2px accent `:focus-visible` ring throughout, and a
skip link is the first stop in the tab order.

- **Services accordion** — real `button`s with `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls`.
- **Testimonial rail** — `aria-live="polite"`; autoplay suspends on hover and on
  focus, and stands down entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion`, which also
  flattens every transition on the page.
- **Enquiry form** — native inputs with real labels. Validation fires on submit
  rather than on every keystroke, errors are tied to their field with
  `aria-describedby` / `aria-invalid`, focus moves to the first field that failed,
  and the result is announced through `role="status"`.
- **Legal dialogs** — `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal`, Escape to close, focus
  moved in on open and returned to the trigger on close, and Tab trapped inside.
